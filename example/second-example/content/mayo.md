##IS MAYO GOOD?

It's actually a trick question because mayonaise is actually god **awful** due to not only its pure greasy-ness but _disgusting taste_ too!

##BUT IT'S **'GOOD'** IN SANDWICHES

Well that is false information and here is why:
 - McDonald's McChicken sandwhich: who ever gets excited about the mayo in this glorious sandwich? **Nobody**!
 - I don't even need to continue this list in order to make a statement about how awful it is.

The *only* time I can accept mayo is when it is used to make Russian Salad because it's not god awful then :/.
