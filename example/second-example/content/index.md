##WHY IS MUSTARD THE BEST?##

Contrarty many people's **opinions**, mustard is not only the tastiest sauce that exists... but also the most _versatile_! It can go well in a Salad's dressing or in the infamous New York style hotdog that is just soooo *dreamy* :)) 

A dish that many people don't think of is the gorgeous 'mustard-stuffed chicken', which makes me dribble as I write this due to the sheer volume of **amazing taste**!
