##WHAT MAKES KETCHUP GOOD?##

Ketchup is always the staple food that goes well with **french fries** or _chips_ as the 'Brits' may call them. Although I personally prefer mustard, when I go to Shake Shack Ihave to get a small bucket of ketchup as my preferred dip, it's just too **good**!

##WHAT IS THE BEST KETCHUP?##

This is probably the easiest question ever since Heinz have been dominating the market since their existance in January 1869. It's been a staple to society, with Heinz even being popular with pop artists! What more could you say about it? Well... The zero sugar ketchup by Heinz is god **awful**!!! _I wouldn't even recommend it to my enemies_ :(
